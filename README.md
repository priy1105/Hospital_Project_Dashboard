## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1.  **Database Setup:**
    * Set up a **MySQL** database instance.
    * Execute the `hospital_data.sql` script to create the `hospital_data` database, its tables, and populate them with the initial data.

2.  **Data Source (Optional):**
    * The raw data files (`.csv` and `.xlsx` files in the `Datasets` folder) are provided if direct import/connection to the flat files is preferred over SQL.

3.  **Power BI Dashboard:**
    * Open the Power BI file (not explicitly provided but assumed to exist) in Power BI Desktop.
    * Ensure the data connections within the Power BI file are updated to point to your hosted MySQL database or the local CSV/Excel files.
